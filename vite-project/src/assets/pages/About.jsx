        <h2>My name is Bella!</h2>
        <p>I'm a computer science student at UIC who likes to draw, write, and code!
            My creative excursions fuel my drive for my computer science goals.
            I've enjoyed working with computers for a while, and in my childhood, I've dabbled
            in game development and 3D modeling. Now that I'm older, my enjoyment of creative hobbies
            and programming has come together, and I'd like to keep that sentiment as I grow.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my time with programming, I've grown interest in cybersecurity and web development, and 
            I'm looking forward see how my interests fluctuate. Whatever I end up doing, I hope I'll still
            have time to pursue my hobbies, like (hopefully) producing a webcomic!
